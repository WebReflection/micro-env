This is the version built for node and others\r\n  * [oop.js](build/oop.js) to include only `Function` and `Object` related snippets\r\n  * [dom.js](build/dom.js) to include only `DOM` related shortcuts, browsers only\r\n  * [base.js](build/base.js) to include only plain `Object` related snippets","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
